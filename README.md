# buster-mode

buster-mode is a minor mode for emacs to speed up development when writing tests
with [Buster.js](http://busterjs.org).

## Keybinding

All keybindings in buster-mode start with `C-c C-b` and then a two-letter mnemonic shortcut.

* `td`: toggle-deferred will toggle // in the name of the current test.
